# Appendix B: Authorship and Identity Verification

### Purpose of This Document

This document provides authorship verification and continuity evidence for the research presented in *Structural Cognition and Future Human Systems*. Its purpose is to establish the identity of the primary author, demonstrate longitudinal continuity of research activity, and describe the public record mechanisms used to verify authorship and time-stamped existence. This document functions as a supporting verification record rather than a substantive research contribution.

### Primary Author

The primary author of this research is **Xufen Tu**, working as an independent researcher.

### Public Identity Anchors and Verification Records

To ensure transparent authorship verification and long-term continuity, the author maintains publicly accessible digital identity anchors that link research outputs to persistent, time-stamped records. These anchors are designed to distinguish human authorship from non-personal system definitions and archival records.

The primary digital identity anchor used for authorship verification is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) record **tux133144.eth**. Additional ENS records, including **pfip-tux133144.eth** and **freq-sovereign.eth**, are used to separate protocol-level definitions and archival materials from personal identity. Together, these records establish authorship continuity, system-layer separation, and non-personal protocol governance.

### Public Time-Stamped Records

Original research frameworks, protocol definitions, and supporting materials associated with this work are publicly archived through independent, decentralized mechanisms. These include Ethereum Name Service (ENS) text records, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) content addressing, and cryptographic hash references such as SHA-256.

These mechanisms provide independently verifiable timestamps and authorship traceability without reliance on institutional intermediaries or centralized publication authorities.

---

### Longitudinal Public Presence

Research outputs, analytical reflections, and system models related to this work have been published and maintained over multiple years across publicly accessible platforms. These platforms include professional networking environments, technical repositories, and decentralized identity and archival systems.

This pattern of publication demonstrates continuity of research activity over time rather than episodic or isolated output.

---

### Cross-Domain Professional Background

The author has more than ten years of entrepreneurial and system-level professional experience in China, including work related to hardware manufacturing, engineering systems, product development, and consumer behavior analysis.

Subsequent research activity conducted in the United States has focused on cognitive systems, digital identity structures, and boundary questions emerging in the context of artificial intelligence and human–machine interaction.

---

### Independence and Institutional Status

This research is conducted independently. No institutional funding, employment affiliation, or organizational representation is claimed.

This independence is intentional and central to the research design, enabling the exploration of structural and governance questions without institutional constraints.

---

### Record Maintenance and Continuity

The public records and identity anchors referenced in this document were established and maintained prior to and including **December 2025**. These records provide verifiable evidence of authorship continuity and temporal precedence for the research materials associated with this work.

This appendix is provided solely for authorship verification and record continuity purposes.
